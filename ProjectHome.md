This is a free light multilingual php5/mvc/framework that you can either customize to create your own site in no time, or learn more about the mechanisms behind mvc frameworks and build your own:

- user account interface/registration, authentification, pwd recovery, email confirmation service etc.
- customized dialog boxes( as well as on-off sound effects)
- customized phplayermenu lib for handing menus
- article drafting/editing in admin section with tinyMCE
- photo/video gallery module
- a paging module,
- phplivex for ajax
- phpmailer,
- js lib for stylish date picker
- a custom form lib
- user geolocalisation lib
- captcha support
- config file
- design handled with css

It still lacks features like a built-in webshop and the admin functionalities could well be extended, but this is a fully stable and usable project.
